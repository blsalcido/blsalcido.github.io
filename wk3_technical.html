        <h4>A Work in Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to my technical blog - a place where I attempt to describe various programming
    	    concepts assuming no knowledge of my audience. My goal is to write in such a way that 
          I would have understood these topics on the day when I first learned what a computer is.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>   
    	    It will be readily apparent to anyone with more knowledge than I have that I am still 
    	    very much a beginner. Should you find yourself aware of any misunderstandings I may have 
    	    of anything I describe within this blog, feel free to email me with you insights 
    	    <a href="mailto:bls.salcido@gmail.com">here</a>. I'm always open to learning more and appreciate different 
    	    perpectives and constructive criticism as tools for development and growth as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I hope you find the time you spend here to be visually pleasant. My goals for
          the presentation of this site are to help visitors feel invited and relaxed by using soft and 
          calming colors and to give the sense of overall simplicity and ease of navigation. Enjoy!

        <p>
         In order to understand the usefulness of JavaScript, lets first think about the role of HTML/CSS.
        </p> 
        <strong>HTML</strong>, HyperText Markup Language, is a language that defines component parts of the
        <strong>content</strong> of a web page. It should have no bearing on the look of a web page but, rather, 
        serve the sole purpose of defining the content that exists within a given site. 
        <p>
        <strong>CSS</strong>, Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to define the <strong>appearance</strong> of a given web page. It formats and styles the information that is contained within an HTML document. CSS greatly affects the way users perceive web pages as it is responsible not only for overall design but also for navigation on a site. 
        </p>
        <p>
        With HTML and CSS languages, it is possible to create static web pages that require forms to engage with visitors. This means that any time these static pages want to retrieve information from a user, a form has to be filled out and sent back to a server wheere a new page is created and sent back to the user's browser. Essentially this means a lot of waiting time for the user. Each time they try to interact with the page, they have to fill out a form and wait for a new page to load. This is where JavaScript comes in to save the day. 
        </p> 
        <p>
        JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. This means it is capable of representing concepts as whole "objects" that have data associated with them - information that describes the object. Object-oriented languages like JavaScript also have built-in procedures known as methods, or, functions. These functions are used to organize and manipulate data that pertains to "objects" in order to design applications and computer programs. 
        </p>
        <p>
        JavaScript's multi-dimensional capabilities help transform static web sites into more dynamic, user-friendly environments in which the page is able to respond to user actions without requiring the user to wait for new pages to load while their request is being processed.
        </p>
        <p>
        JavaScript also allows web developers to add aminations, pop-ups, and slideshows to web pages. This can be very useful when attempting to draw a user's attention to a specific part of the web page and improves the visitor's overall experience. This explains why JavaScript gained so much popularity among developers in the early days of web development. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Also noteworthy is <a href = "http://nodejs.org" target = "_blank">node.js</a>. Node is a platform for building scalable applications that maximize throughput and efficiency. Node applications are written in JavaScript and the advantage here is node's asynchronous I/O model that aids in the processing of data for real-time applications. Asynchronous, or, "non-blocking I/O" is a type of input/output processing that allows for the continual processing of data before transmission is complete. This model for processing information greatly improves the responsiveness of applications and has added to the popularity of JavaScript as a powerful and dynamic language.
