        <h4>A Work in Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to my technical blog - a place where I attempt to describe various programming
    	    concepts assuming no knowledge of my audience. My goal is to write in such a way that 
          I would have understood these topics on the day when I first learned what a computer is.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>   
    	    It will be readily apparent to anyone with more knowledge than I have that I am still 
    	    very much a beginner. Should you find yourself aware of any misunderstandings I may have 
    	    of anything I describe within this blog, feel free to email me with you insights 
    	    <a href="mailto:bls.salcido@gmail.com">here</a>. I'm always open to learning more and appreciate different 
    	    perpectives and constructive criticism as tools for development and growth as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I hope you find the time you spend here to be visually pleasant. My goals for
          the presentation of this site are to help visitors feel invited and relaxed by using soft and 
          calming colors and to give the sense of overall simplicity and ease of navigation. Enjoy!

        <h1 id = "java_h1">Object Oriented vs. Functional Programming</h1>
        

        <p>
          Object oriented languages like Ruby are ideal in situations in which the programmer wants to add new features to their code. I think the best way to think about this is to consider Pseudocode. When you Pseudocode, you establish all the things you want your code to do and outline how you will accomplish these things. So, by the time you get to writing the actual code, you have already decided that you have a pre-determined set of operations that your code will perform. As you continue to write your code, you'll primarily be adding new things on which you can perform these operations. You can do this by adding new classes that call existing methods and your other classes (classes you've already written) will remain untouched.  
        </p> 

     
        <p>
          Functional programming languages like Java are ideal in the opposite situation: situations in which the programmer does not know how many operations they want to add to their program. So, the number of things to which they are adding opperations is pre-determined prior to writing the code.
