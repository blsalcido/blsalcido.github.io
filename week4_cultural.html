      <h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
      </h2>
        I used to commonly pick fights with my husband when I felt that he wasn't showing enough consideration 
        when it came to house keeping. I'm going to focus on the time when it became clear to me that my husband
        needed more from me in order to make the changes I had been asking him for. My husband's name is Grant. 
     </p>
     <br>
    
     <p>
      <h2>What was the source of the conflict?</h2>
       After work, Grant often feels burned out and wants to spend his time unwinding with video games, a workout, 
       and dinner. Things like tidiness simply aren't on his mind. It's completely understandable when I'm in a 
       normal mood. But, at times when I am feeling stressed and/or overwhelmed, I tend to be extra sensitive to 
       Grant's inattention to where he tosses his work clothes or whether or not there are dishes in the sink 
       or trash cans that need emptying. On the particular occasion that I am thinking of as I write this, I was 
       making dinner and Grant was sitting on our couch playing Skyrim. I felt as if he had forgotten about me 
       and didn't care that I was doing things he didn't want to do even though I didn't want to do them either. 
       So, like a mature adult, I began slamming cabinets and over-exaggerating actions like chopping sweet 
       potatoes so that I would make more noise than usual in the hopes of getting Grant's attention.

      <h2>How did you handle that conflict?</h2>
       Keeping the compass of shame in mind, I would say that normally I am an avoider. That's probably my home of 
       all the other categories. It would explain why I am a perfectionist and a procrastinator. But, I hate 
       categorizing myself and this story is a good example of why I hate this: Depending on the situation, I feel 
       at home in all categories of the compass of shame. It is highly mood and circumstance dependent for me. So, 
       in this particular example I became the "blame others" version of myself. I blamed Grant for how I was feeling.
       I attacked him with hurtful words and accusations that he didn't care about me. I raised my voice and complained that it was unfair that I was expected to clean up after him day and night even though I was also tired and wanted to relax after a long day. I waved the clothes he had tossed onto the ground when he came home in front of his face and shouted that I wasn't his maid. After trying to apologize and appearing rather confused and lost for words, Grant eventually tired out and went upstairs for some space. Since I'm so awesome, I followed him; still shouting. I told him he couldn't just turn his back on me and that he couldn't just run away from conflict when ever he felt uncomfortable (he's a withdrawn type).

      <h2>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h2>
        My actions prolonged the conflict. Instead of allowing Grant time to reflect on my concerns and decide how he wanted to respond, I pressured him to rush the process resulting in it taking both of us twice as long to internalize how we were making the other feel. My actions caused Grant momentary sadness becuase he always has my best interest at heart and never wants me to feel overlooked or disrespected by him. He was really trying to explain his actions to me in the moment but was finding it difficult because my hot-headedness was making him uncomfortable and tongue-tied. I can be very aggressive. I like my aggression and am glad it's available to me in certain situations but, when it comes to communicating with my loved-one, I'd rather handle things patiently and considerately.

      <h2>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h2>
        Since there's a happy ending to this story and I learned something from things going down the way they did, it's hard to say if would do anything differently given the chance. Honestly, this question kind of pisses me off because it's pointless to ponder. You can't take actions back so, there's no sense in contemplating what you would do if you could. I think that sets you up for heartache and sells you short of internalizing the importance of what you learned from what did happen. Mistakes are how you learn. It's tempting to say I wish I could take back every time I made Grant or anyone else I love feel bad for making mistakes but, we're all human and regret is just a narrative that serves the purpose of guiding future actions, not past actions.

      <h2>What did you learn from this experience?</h2>
        When all the dust settled from our argument, Grant and I had a heart-to-heart conversation about how each of us was feeling. I remember him telling me that he can't always interpret what I mean when I paint in broad strokes about how I'm not his maid. That's not specific. It's not kind. And it's not actionable. My indirect form of communication confuses Grant and stiffles his ability to please me becasue it doesn't provide him with any guidence and makes him feel attacked and ashamed for not being a better husband. I realized that all along, we hadn't been having a problem of Grant not wanting to help, we had been having a problem of Grant not knowing how he could be helping. In order for him to help out, I need to provide him with specific and actionable requests; and it's better if I ask him on the spot rather than several days in advance so that he doesn't forget. I also learned that I alone am responsible for how I feel. Even if I think someone is behaving unfairly, it's up to me to regulate how I'm processing their actions emotionally. So far, it's been easy to implement what I've learned; partly becasue it makes the actual conflict much more "efficient" which in the context of conflicts, to me, translates to "faster." And since the aforementioned conflict happened, Grant's been extremely helpful and vigilant of where he puts his dirty laundry and even helps do the dishes on a regular basis. Much better.
