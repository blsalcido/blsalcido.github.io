        <h4>A Work in Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to my technical blog - a place where I attempt to describe various programming
    	    concepts assuming no knowledge of my audience. My goal is to write in such a way that 
          I would have understood these topics on the day when I first learned what a computer is.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>   
    	    It will be readily apparent to anyone with more knowledge than I have that I am still 
    	    very much a beginner. Should you find yourself aware of any misunderstandings I may have 
    	    of anything I describe within this blog, feel free to email me with you insights 
    	    <a href="mailto:bls.salcido@gmail.com">here</a>. I'm always open to learning more and appreciate different 
    	    perpectives and constructive criticism as tools for development and growth as a programmer.
        </p>

          I hope you find the time you spend here to be visually pleasant. My goals for
          the presentation of this site are to help visitors feel invited and relaxed by using soft and 
          calming colors and to give the sense of overall simplicity and ease of navigation. Enjoy!

          Git is a tool that manages the history of your projects. Git is able to manage the history of your projects (changes you made to your project, earlier versions of your pojects, etc.) using version control. Version control is simply a systematic process by which you are able to track the progress of your projects over time by labeling each change you made to the project so that you can access previous versions of your project on a timeline. The lables of the changes you make are called "commits". Using git is sort of like being able to hit "rewind" on an art project. What if you mess up the nose of a face you're painting? Or what if you're just not sure if you like the morst recent changes you made to the nose you're painting more than you like its earlier version? If there were such a thing as git for painters, artists would be able to undo the mistakes they made to a painting and return to an earlier version of their work. Github, on the other hand, is a service that enables git users to share and collaberate on Git repositories. So, to use the painting example again, Github would be a warehouse full of paintings by multiple artists where other artists could make changes to the paintings and work together to decide which changes are best. You can upload your Git repositories to Github where changes can be made to them by multiple people without the risk of loosing access to their original and step-by-step versions. This is how Github helps with version control.

          Developers use version control (git) even if they are working independently on projects for a number of reasons. First, git allows developers to revert to previous versions of their code if they realize they've made a mistake. Git also allows developers to submit changes to code that someone else wrote thereby giving them the opportunity to persuade the other person that their changes make the code more efficient. Version control allows developers to let other people work on their code and to see where the changes are being made and who is making them.

          Open Source is a term used to describe the sharing of how a program was built. In other words, the sharing of the code that was written for a program that a user interfaces with. Photoshop is the example that comes to mind. Many people use and are familiar with Photoshop but, the people that own the rights to this program have chosen to keep their source code (the part of the program the user doesn't see) private so that they can control who sees it and who can make changes to it. If they didn't do this, anyone could make changes to the code and make their own versions of Photoshop and Photoshop's current owners would essentially loose control over their product.

          I think open source is fantastic and probably one of the reasons technology is evolving so quickly. In the comparitively small amount of time I've spent writing code, I've noticed it's hard sometimes to arbitrate my own mind. In other words, I like that open source gives me the option of having fresh eyes on my code in the future without robbing me of the option to keep my code private. Participating in open source is voluntary and doesn't make me nervous for that reason. Also, I find it to be inspiring for a number of reasons. What if all industries behaved this way? It seems to me everyone would have access to more information and more ways to build upon their own creativity. I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in my spare time and can't help but think of the following as a comparison: Sometimes, I learn a new technique for a jiu-jitsu move that makes the move more high-percentage, meaning, I'm more likely to tap my opponent using this new technique I've learned than I was before I learned how to make the move more efficient. When I was a white-belt (n00b), I wanted to keep all these new techniques I was learning to myself. I didn't want to tell any of my opponents (classmates I roll with) how they could improve because I wanted to have the monopoly on the new and improved move. I wanted to be the best and hoard all the glory for myself. Truly a n00b thing to do. I realized quickly that there was no satisfaction in this. Sure, I could keep surprising my classmates by using a special pass or escape to catch them off guard but, I soon realized it would take me much longer to improve this way. In order to push myself beyond plateaus, I learned I should give away as much information as possible - make everyone around me better - so that I could find new ways to improve myself. I sort of look at open source the same way. Sure, there are some cases in which you want to keep information private (maybe you're working on something you thing no one else has thought of yet - and even then maybe you would want to reveal certain sections of your code to gain insight from others without giving too much away) and in BJJ there are situations in which you would never tell your opponent your secrets (competition). But, I think technology is driven by creativity. It's not through beating your head against the wall as a programmer striving only to improve the tricks you've learned that makes it possible to contribute to the progression of technology. It's finding new tricks around which you can build new models that makes your old way of doing things obsolete. Including others in this process can be incredibly useful and inspiring.

          Using licenses is important because they allow other people to help you by making changes to your work without the need to obtain special permission from a third-party. Licenses also help ensure that you will always get credit as the original creator of your work. If you are licensed, no one else can claim your work as their own.
