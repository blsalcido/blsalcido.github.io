      <h2>Thinking Style</h2>
    
      <p>
        So, I took the thinking style's test and my results say I am stronger in abstract thought. I read the description of this and I feel it described me about as well as a horoscope: If you look for yourself in those things, you'll find you. But, it's hard to say if I really think thinking styles are important to consider and it's strange that we're asked to think about these things when I've been told most CS students are concrete random thinkers considering of all the time we've spent pondering about stereotype threat. I prefer not to consider this any further. I can think and that's all that should matter in the context of doing well at DBC.
