      <h2>Thoughts On Pairing</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>What Was It Like To Pair With Others To Solve Challenges?</h3>
      <p> 
        I love pairing with classmates on challenges. I think it makes the process of combing through errors much easier when I have a partner
        present. There's nothing like another set of eyes to catch things I might ordinarily miss when working alone. I love getting to know 
        everyone I pair with during the check-in phase of our session. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Was Something Particularly Fun Or Rewarding?</h3>
      <p>
        One of my partners figured out a way to draw a map in Stypi for our create your own code combat mission challenge. I thought it was 
        extremely creative and we had a blast making changes to our map and were cracking up over thinking of names for our character. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Was Something Frustrating And Difficult For You?</h3>
      <p>
        Not particularly, although, there are times when it becomes apparent that my partner and I are not as "rabit-hole resistant" as we 
        should be in order to make our session as efficient as possible. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Thoughts On Feedback</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>How Did You Feel When You Read Your Feedback?</h3>
      <p>
        No surprises. I felt like the feedback I got was honest and fair and reflected well upon me. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Was The Feedback You Received Helpful To Your Learning?</h3>
      <p>
        In the most recent instance, only slightly. I haven't had a session in which I felt that enough went wrong for there to be much 
        to elaborate on in terms of suggestions for how I might improve my strategies for learning. The only thing it seems I need to 
        work on so far is pseudocoding to optimize communication between my partner and I. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Based On The Feedback You Received, What Are You Going To Do To Improve Next Time You Pair?</h3>
      <p>
        Next time I pair, I need to be mindful of how I communicate ideas from the start. I should work on my partner on describing the 
        strategy we will use to solve the challenge in plain English and make sure we are both on the same page. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>How Was It To Write Feedback?</h3>
      <p>
        Writing feedback is generally very easy for me. It can be a little difficult to provide something actionable to my partner if 
        our session went really well so, in these cases, I just try to tell them what I liked about our session in particular and 
        suggest that they continue to do it in the future. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>What Was Most Difficult For You When Writing Feedback For Your Pair?</h3>
      <p>
        Thinking of actionable feedback is hard when the session goes perfectly well. I try my best to make sure my feedback is as robust 
        as possible so that my pair can get a lot out of it. Sometimes I feel a bit verbose. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>Overall, What Do You Think Of Using Pairing And Feedback To Guide Your Learning?</h3>
      <p>
      	I like that feedback gives me a great deal of insight into how I can improve as a developer. I will be keeping eyes on how 
      	frequently I am told I was driving throughout my sessions as this is an area in which I am agressively trying to grow.
