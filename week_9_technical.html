        <h2>Single Responsibiliy</h2>
        <p>
          The term single responsibility, in object-oriented programming, asserts that each class should have a singular behavior. That is, that classes should have "one, and only one, reason to change." I will elaborate upon this in a moment. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Classes that have multiple responsibilites are difficult to reuse. This is because the various behaviors are all entangled within the class. So, if a programmer ever wishes to use only one behavior from a given class, it would be impossible if the class had multiple responsibilities. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's think about what it means for a class to have a reason to change. Imagine a module that prints information about a doctor's patients. Several things about this information could change. To name a couple, information about the patients could change and the colums and rows of the information could change. These changes are caused by two separate things: content and aesthetics. Therefore, separate classes should be used to accomplish these behaviors.
