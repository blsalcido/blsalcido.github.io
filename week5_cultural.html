      <h2>Identify a Problem Facing the Tech World</h2>
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p> 
        The biggest challenge I can think of is the potential problem of finding a job outside of SF. 
      </p>
      
      <br>
      <br>   
      
      <h2>Explain Why It's a Problem and Some Background</h2>
      
      <br>
      <br>
  
      <p>
        This is a potential problem because I do not have a traditional CS background and will therefore possible be most qualified for positions at companies that aren't so small they need me to be able to hit the ground running and arent so large that they want me to have a BS in the field. This will be an issue since I do not plan to live in SF, where there are more employment options of this kind, following DBC. 
      </p> 
      
      <h2>Hypothesize About Potential Solutions</h2>
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p>
        Freelance and/or find a position with a company that will allow me to work from a remote loaction.
