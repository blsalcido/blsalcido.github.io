      <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
    
      <p>
       I am not convinced that stereotype threat is real. The results of all stereotype threat studies are correlational, not causal and seem to conveniently serve the interest of academics whose hearts bleed for equality among genders and all races.

       There are, indeed, differences between the sexes and between races but, that these differences need not be compared to one another as superior or inferior traits. Rather, it is simply important to recognize the existence of  these differences. For instance, the differences in structure between male and female brains, differences in body composition across various ethnicities, and differences in intelligence between races. It seems that all the studies I've come across that pertain to Stereotype Threat attempt to prove that observable differences in performance between different races and genders are caused by individuals reacting to situations in which they self-identify with a stereotyped group and that if not for the threat of being stereotyped, these differences would not be observed at all. It's as though no one is willing to accept that these differences are real because they're afraid of what these differences might imply. But, for starters, the differences between individuals are far greater than any established differences between races in general and furthermore, that isn't a "bad" thing. It's just a thing. I feel like I might be accused of being a racist or a sexist simply because I believe that there are differences between groups in general and that's heart wrenching to me. Science is just a tool for understanding the world we occupy and I think it's a pity to deny that which is supported empirically simply because it makes one subjectively uncomfortable.

        I am also suspicious of anyone who does not site the Bell Curve in their research on stereotype threat because I have to wonder: Do they find the material in this book to be offensive? There seems to be no attempt to convince an audience that the findings of the researchers of the book, The Bell Curve (fundamentally that, there are indeed differences in intelligence of different kinds i.e., athletic intelligence, academic intelligence between men and women and all races but, that the differences between individuals is greater than the differences between any two races or between man and woman). Rather, the book is ignored altogether by researchers preaching the importance of their own work because it supports some aim they all seem to have to make everyone the same and to place blame and shame on anyone who might observe differences between genders and ethnicities.

        I think that there are "findings" of stereotype studies but, I think the findings show that  it is possible to deflate one's confidence prior to asking them to perform a task and I believe that can hinder their performance. However, I'm not convinced that their confidence is deflated just because they identify with a certain group before learning that that group has shown poor performance on the task that they are about to perform. Rather, I believe that you could leave race and sex and gender out of it completely (not ask the participants to identify with a group) and get similar results as compared with the results of tests in which participants are asked to identify with a group.

        Also, how many times are individuals tested for performance on a task prior to being given any information of their "group"? Do these studies actually compare "threat performance" to average normal performance in test participants? 
      </p>
      
      <p>
         I do not feel affected by stereotype threat and am surprised that I should be asked to weigh my thoughts on it when, if it were actually real (which it's not) it would be self-perpetuating and better off ignored.
