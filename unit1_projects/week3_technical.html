          Welcome to my technical blog - a place where I attempt to describe various programming
    	  concepts assuming no knowledge of my audience. My goal is to write in such a way that 
          I would have understood these topics on the day when I first learned what a computer is.
    	  <br>
    	  <br>
    	  It will be readily apparent to anyone with more knowledge than I have that I am still 
    	  a beginner myself. Should you find yourself aware of any misunderstandings I may have 
    	  of anything I describe within this blog, feel free to email me with you insights at 
    	  bls.salcido@gmail.com. I'm always open to learning more and appreciate different 
    	  perpectives and constructive criticism as tools for development and growth as a programmer.
          <br>
          <br>
          I hope you find the time you spend here to be visually and audibly pleasant. My goals for
          the presentation of this site are to make any visitor relaxed by using soft and calming 
          colors and to give the sense of overall simplicity and ease of navigation. Enjoy!
