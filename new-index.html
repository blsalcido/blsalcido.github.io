       <strong>Welcome to my first website!</strong>
       <br>

       I am currently a Phase-0 student at DBC - San Francisco.
       In technical terms, this means I'm a n00b at web development.

       So far, learning how to code has been incredibly challenging
       and inspiring. I'm looking forward to the day when I'll be able 
       to bring beautiful, useful, and reliable programs to users 
       everywhere.

       I am originally from Arizona but currently live in Hawaii
       with my husband. It's been wonderful living in Hawaii in
       spite of pining for quality time with the family and friends
       we left in Arizona. Hawaii is the sort of place that fosters
       tranquility and happiness and it'll be hard to say goodbye to
       it when the time comes.

       All nostalgia aside...oh wait a minute...

       It sure is lovely here.

       As I was saying, all melodrama aside, it's exciting to ponder 
       the many changes that await my husband and me. We always have 
       been the adventurers of the family...
       <br>

       <br>
       And, of course, there's always the possibility of children in 
       the not-so-distant future. That is, if we can ever figure "it" out...
       <br>

       <br>
       <br>
       Then again, I might still have too much "fight" left in me for kids...

       Indeed, leaving Hawaii will have its difficulties. But, hey, 
       at least I don't have it as bad as this poor fellow...
