        <h4>A Work in Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to my technical blog - a place where I attempt to describe various programming
    	    concepts assuming no knowledge of my audience. My goal is to write in such a way that 
          I would have understood these topics on the day when I first learned what a computer is.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>   
    	    It will be readily apparent to anyone with more knowledge than I have that I am still 
    	    very much a beginner. Should you find yourself aware of any misunderstandings I may have 
    	    of anything I describe within this blog, feel free to email me with you insights 
    	    <a href="mailto:bls.salcido@gmail.com">here</a>. I'm always open to learning more and appreciate different 
    	    perpectives and constructive criticism as tools for development and growth as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I hope you find the time you spend here to be visually pleasant. My goals for
          the presentation of this site are to help visitors feel invited and relaxed by using soft and 
          calming colors and to give the sense of overall simplicity and ease of navigation. Enjoy!

        <p>
         Here I will attempt to describe the differences and similarities between arrays and hashes, the different ways in which it is possible to loop in Ruby, and weigh the pros and cons of JavaScript and Ruby. 

         <!-- Links to methodology for choosing between each of these. -->

        </p> 

        <p>
         What are arrays and what are hashes? In the most basic sense, they're the same thing. Yep, I said it. I'll attempt a comparison: You can think of arrays and hashes like vehicles. <strong>Basically</strong>, all vehicles are the same thing. Value judgements aside, a sedan is a truck is a motorcycle is a bus is a van is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Pigeon"> flying pigeon</a>. Fundamentally, they're all the same but, each posesses features that make their use ideal in some situations but not in others. Arrays and hashes are both sets of data. They are sets, fundamentally. But each have certain characteristics that are better suited to certain situations. 

        <p>
         So what "sets" arrays and hashes apart? (Yes, I'm proud of myself.) Arrays give programmers no control over the key associated with a value, or, "element". The key, or "index", of an array is automatically set by virtue of the data structure itself and cannot be altered. No matter the content of the array, it's element will be set to a corresponding index number by default in the order that the information was passed in to the array. [Example]
        </p>
        
        <p>
         Hashes, on the other hand, give the programmer the option to customize the key assignment associated with a givel value. Hashes are relational: They store information based on key-value pairs. The content within a given has is in no particular order as with arrays. To make another comparison with HTML in mind: Hashes are like the unordered lists of HTML and arrays are like ordered lists. In unordered lists, you can customize the bullet point and don't necessarily care about your information being represented in cronological order whereas ordered lists are more appropriate for situations where the designer is particular about the order in which their information is contained and/or represented. 
        </p> 
        
        <p>
         So, indeed there are differences between arrays and hashes and these differences make them more appropriate under some circumstances than in others but, fundamentally, they are both the same thing: Sets of information. That's it. So, how to decide whether to use an array or a hash?

        JavaScript's multi-dimensional capabilities help transform static web sites into more dynamic, user-friendly environments in which the page is able to respond to user actions without requiring the user to wait for new pages to load while their request is being processed.
        </p>
        <p>
        JavaScript also allows web developers to add aminations, pop-ups, and slideshows to web pages. This can be very useful when attempting to draw a user's attention to a specific part of the web page and improves the visitor's overall experience. This explains why JavaScript gained so much popularity among developers in the early days of web development. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Also noteworthy is <a href = "http://nodejs.org" target = "_blank">node.js</a>. Node is a platform for building scalable applications that maximize throughput and efficiency. Node applications are written in JavaScript and the advantage here is node's asynchronous I/O model that aids in the processing of data for real-time applications. Asynchronous, or, "non-blocking I/O" is a type of input/output processing that allows for the continual processing of data before transmission is complete. This model for processing information greatly improves the responsiveness of applications and has added to the popularity of JavaScript as a powerful and dynamic language.
