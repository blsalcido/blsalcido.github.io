      <h2>Revisit your Affirming your Values blog post and relate it to what you learned about stereotype threat. </h2>
    
      <p>
       As I said in last week's blog, I do not feel comfortable discussing stereotype threat here. Ask me about it via email if you care to have a conversation with me on this topic.

      <h2> How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat? </h2>

       <h2>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down at DBC?</h2>

        Mindfulness, and time alone help me tremendously. I hope to have at least an hour to myself each day during the afternoon or evening to reflect and digest everything I've learned. Lifting weights and walking are both like mental sanctuaries to me and I hope to spend time doing both on a daily basis.
