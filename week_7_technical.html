        <h2>About This Blog</h2>
        <h4>A Work in Progress</h4>
        <p>
          Welcome to my technical blog - a place where I attempt to describe various programming
    	    concepts assuming no knowledge of my audience. My goal is to write in such a way that 
          I would have understood these topics on the day when I first learned what a computer is.
    	  </p>
    	  <p>   
    	    It will be readily apparent to anyone with more knowledge than I have that I am still 
    	    very much a beginner. Should you find yourself aware of any misunderstandings I may have 
    	    of anything I describe within this blog, feel free to email me with you insights 
    	    <a href="mailto:bls.salcido@gmail.com">here</a>. I'm always open to learning more and appreciate different 
    	    perpectives and constructive criticism as tools for development and growth as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I hope you find the time you spend here to be visually pleasant. My goals for
          the presentation of this site are to help visitors feel invited and relaxed by using soft and 
          calming colors and to give the sense of overall simplicity and ease of navigation. Enjoy!

        <h1 id = "java_h1">SQL/NoSQL</h1>
        

        <p>
          NoSQL databases are prefered for situations in which enormous amounts of data are involved. They also run on large clusters of servers and can still hold unique fields in all documents accross each server.   
        </p>

        <p>
          For smaller projects, SQL is sufficient but does not provide developers with as much control over their data as compared to NoSQL. 
        </p>
