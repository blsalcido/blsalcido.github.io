        <h2>Static Positioning</h2>
          <p>
          	The static position of css elements can be thought of as their default position. There are no specifications about positioning made here. Static positioning is automatic and will place elements in a given css project according to their placement in the flow of the document. In otherwords, the elements would be placed one after another in the order that they appear in the css document.

        <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
          <p>
          	The relative positioning of a css element will result in the element being placed with respect to the positioning of the elements that come before and after it within the css document. Unlike static positioning, the relative position uses top, left, right, and bottom properties and shifts the element in the opposite direction. So, setting an element to relative top30px would result in it being moved downward, away from the static element by 30px. 
          	Below is an example of relative positioning:

        <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
          <p>
          	Absolute positioning occurrs in relation to the document itself and thus allows an element to be positioned anywhere within the HTML document. Absolute elements will scroll with the page. Absolute positioning may be used with percentages to allow the designer to determine the percentage height and width of a given element. The element will then adjust its size automatically as the document size is modified. In other words, if percentages are used on the element, whenever a given document is expanded or decreased in size, the element will adjust with the change in document size so that the percentages that were assigned to it will stay proportionate to the scale of the document. This is what happens when I change the positioning of the header of this site to absolute:

          </p>

        <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
          <p>
          	Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning in that it will allow an element to be placed anywhere on the page but, rather than the element's position being relative to the HTML document, it will instead be relative to the browser window. Fixed positioning does not allow elements to move with the page while scrolling. An example of fixed positioning can be seen <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/demo/css-fixed-position.php" target = "blank">here.</a>
