    	  Pinterest is one of my favorite sites becasue it helps me in a couple
		    of different ways. First, Pinterest gives me access to a wide range
		    of blogs and sites that I might not otherwise find by doing a simple
		    google search. Second, it organizes the content by categories so that           
		    if I am looking for something of a particular subject, I can search by 
		    category to begin browsing the results. Third, Pinterest allows me to
		    bookmark, or, "pin", things I might want to look at later so that I 
		    won't loose track of where I found the things I like. I can even 
		    orgainize my pins into personalized categories. I used to have
		    to do google searches and then bookmark everything I liked but, 
		    Pinterest takes away the need for this. Fourth, Pinterest allows me 
		    to follow boards containing other people's pins. This serves the 
		    purpose of connecting me to the pins of other users who have similar
		    interests. By following their boards, I am more likely to see stuff
		    I like on my home feed. The purpose of pinterest is to inspire, 
		    motivate, connect users to information, connect businesses and bloggers
		    to potential followers, and to help users identify their interests and
		    orgainize them. Pinterest achieves its purpose and its purpose is 
		    parallel to it's visual qualities.

		    There are several things I like about Pinterest design-wise. 
		    The first thing I like about pinterest is how clean it looks in spite
		    of there being so much content being displayed. The background color 
		    is neutral so as to off-set all potentially distracting colors. 
		    I can tell you exactly what the pinterest logo looks like without 
		    presently looking at it. I would imagine that someone worked very
		    purposefully while designing the look and placement of the logo to 
		    ensure it would be noticed. It has a bright red color and a 
		    "pinteresting" font. I never realized just how much my eyes are drawn
		    to the logo until considering it just now. Even when I step 
		    back, the logo still seems dominant to me. Thumbnails are a close
		    second, of course, and I'm glad they're also so obvious becasue
		    that's a huge part of the site - displaying content to a user in
		    picture form. When you highlight a thumbnail, you see a little red
		    button on the top left hand corner that allows you to "pin" the 
		    thumbnail to one of your own boards. I think it was smart of the
		    designer not to keep the appearence of these buttons fixed so
		    that they only show up when the pin is highlighted. Surely, the 
		    site would look really distracting otherwise. Visually, I would 
		    describe the site as: Clean, Crisp, Organized, Fresh, and New.
		    I also want to add that I like the fact that the name Pinterest
		    itself is descriptive of the site's function. "Pin [your] interest".
		    How cute!

       When you look at the home page, there's a sign-in/sign-up pop-up
       that's in a fixed position on the screen. Behind the pop-up is 
       a scrolling display of images that you might find on Pinterest.
       I love the look of this! It's beautiful and inviting. It makes 
       me want to be a member so I can look at all the pretty things!
       In order to browse Pinterest, you HAVE to be a member. I'm not 
       sure what advantage this serves to the creators of the site and
       I didn't like having to become a member a few months after I had 
       been using Pinterest without being a member. It used to be optional.
       Although, I believe you could only pin posts if you were a member.
       I don't usually like having to sign up as a member in order to use
       a website - it's a little annoying and I'd rather not have to remember
       ANOTHER password. However, Pinterest is well worth the minor 
       annoyance of becoming a member of the site to me becasuse, after 
       being on the site for a few hours, I feel inspired, motivated, 
       up-lifted, creative, and like I've learned something in the case of 
       reading a bunch of "do it yourself" blogs. Sometimes I do feel I've 
       wasted a lot of time but, whenever I find myself using a tip from a 
       DIY blog or happily pondering what kind of treehouse I'll live in one 
       day while I pump gas into my honda, I'm actually glad that I can 
       experience Pinterest daily.

       It's very easy to navigate through Pinterest from all pages of
       the site. I feel like everything is only a click or two away 
       from where I am. There's a search bar to help you find specifics
       (maybe something in particular that you've seen before) and there's 
       also a helpful drop-down menu in the upper left corner of the site
       from which you can select a category to browse (humor, DIY, fashion,
       technology, etc). It's also simple enough to find your own pins.
       All you have to do is click the little pin button next to your user
       name in the top right hand corner of the page and you can do this 
       from anywhere on the site.

       Pinterest doesn't really sell anything and I can't say I've purchased
       anything pinterest-related (ie from a site that a pin links to 
       directly). That said, I HAVE purchased items for DIY projects at 
       my local stores. It might be clever to earn points at a store if 
       you are shopping there becasue of something you saw on Pinterest. 
       Maybe that's a cool way for bloggers to make some money. :)

       The Pinterest of food. Seriously. I wouldn't be surprised if the 
       same people who ceated Pinterest also created foodgawker. The biggest
       difference is that foodgawker only deals with food whereas Pinterest
       exposes its users to a wider range of content. Foodgawker is helpful
       in the same ways as pinterest. The thumbnails on this site link to 
       recipies for the dishes displayed as thumbnails. You can favorite 
       dishes you're particularly fond of by clicking a small little heart
       on the botom right hand of their thumbnails and can keep track of them on your 
       favorites page. You also have the option of sharing your favorites 
       page with friends and family. The purpose of foodgawker is to make 
       users drool over delicious looking food, expose the blogs of chefs
       to an audience that may be inclined to follow their work, educate 
       the user on cooking methods by connecting them to detailed descriptions
       on how to use various tools and ingredients to yield the best possible
       flavor, help the user discover new culinary things, and showcase the very 
       best of the culinary trade. These all compare perfectly to my overall 
       visual experience with the site.

       I wish there wasn't a huge advertisement at the top of the home page. 
       This might not be avoidable - maybe the businesses that advertise on this
       site paid for their advertisements to be located there. Still, it really
       bugs me becasue the look of the advertisements doesn't flow with the look 
       of the rest of the site. It's especially a pitty because the quality 
       of the photographs on the site is exquisite. Even when I stand further 
       away from my computer, the ad space is the first thing I notice. :-/
    </p>
  </div>

       That said, I have very few other criticisms for this site. Visially 
       (annoying ad space aside) I would describe the site as inviting, clean, 
       simple, comforting, and pretty. I love that foodgawker uses these 
       qualities to help me get over my boredom of the same-old-same-old
       dishes I make on a regular basis. On foodgawker, I get to explore
       a wide range of meals I can whip up and I can even browse categories 
       like "gluten-free","low-sugar", "easy" to narrow down the possibilities 
       to options that fit what I would like to make for dinner or a special
       occassion. Foodgawker even has a handy "translate" button in case 
       my eyes have been drawn to a recipie that has been written in a foreign
       language. Convenient.

       After perusing foodgawker for several hours, I feel inspired, hungry, 
       an urge to cook, broke (I don't have enough cheese for all this cheese! 
       get it?), and an urge to explore new tastes. Luckily, it's so easy to 
       get from point a to point b on this site, I never STARVE ;) for inspiration
       for new ideas. The only draw back is I frequently have so many tabs 
       open from clicking so many thumbnails that are linked to blogs, it's 
       easy to forget where I started. If that's all I happen to be doing on 
       a Sunday afternoon, though, I really don't mind the messy tabs.

       Foodgawker does not sell anything. (Save ad space) But! If it were possible to purchase 
       some of the mouth-watering food items from this site, I'd be a regular
       for sure (and at LEAST 200lbs overweight...which might be totally 
       worth it).

       Dictionary is one of my favorite sites because it helps me instantly
       overcome the feeling that I don't know what I'm talking about whilst 
       writing something. It's a huge convenience yet, I didn't think to 
       include it in this list initially. I take it for granted but, I use 
       it all the time. Maybe - and here's some fuel for thought - maybe I 
       don't appreciate it as much as I should for its lack of a prettier 
       design. The purpose of dictionary is to inform, educate, service 
       the user in a practical way, entertain the user with various puzzles
       and games the site offers, and translate words to other languages 
       whenever needed. The purpose of dictionary isn't experienced as 
       much as it could be visially. I don't find myself wanting for loads
       of distractions when I'm trying to learn something, which brings
       me to the look of the site.

       The first thing my eye is drawn to when looking at the home page is the
       search bar at the top. When I stand further away, however, I am drawn to 
       the large ad in the center. Not the most important part of the site from
       the user's perspective. As far as the home page is concerned, I would 
       describe it as cluttered, busy, distracting, boring, and even plain in 
       spite of how busy it is. When I search for a word on the site, things
       get a little better. My eyes are drawn to the word I searched for in 
       bold font near the top of the page. To the right, there is a list of 
       sentences that function as examples of how to use the word properly. 
       The site is less busy and cluttered once I search for a word but, still 
       relatively plain looking and still too many ads for my taste. I like that
       the primary colors of the site change as I click through other pages the 
       site offers, like, "thesaurus", for example. That helps me remember 
       exactly where I am in the site at all times.

       It's very easy to use dictionary. In fact, it's one of the first sites I 
       ever visited back in 6th grade. This is possibly why I still use it so 
       much today and haven't really sought after a different site that serves
       the same purpose. You simply search for a word under the reference type 
       you need (ie definition/dictionary, word substitute/thesaurus, translation/
       translator) and read the results of your search. If you were only looking 
       for information on one word to begin with, then you're done. If you were 
       looking for facts on multiple words, it's simple enough to navigate through
       the site to continue your search. All you have to do is enter a new word 
       into the search bar and select a new tab to get a different reference 
       type if needed. After using dictionary, I feel a sense of clarity, relief,
       closure, ability to move on with my writing, and as though I've learned 
       something new. This means the purpose of the site is served thoroughly.

       Dictionary offers a premium package where users are able to remove the 
       ads on the site, get 850,000 example sentences and experience faster
       site speed for $2.99/month. I would never purchase this. It doesn't
       add enough utility to justify spending any money. The site is fast enough
       for my purposes, one example sentence per definition is usually good 
       enough, and the ads don't bother me enough to warrant the cost of 
       an upgrade. I'll continue using for free, thanks. :)
